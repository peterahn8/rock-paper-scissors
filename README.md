# rock-paper-scissors

Rock Paper Scissors is the first JavaScript project in the TOP curriculum. The goal is to build a "rock paper scissors"-style game using conditional statements.

It works, but I'm jealous of the other students' top submissions. In the future, I want to aim for using switch statements to handle large numbers of cases.
